# Documentation Workflow Guide

This guide establishes a comprehensive documentation workflow for software development projects, ensuring consistent and thorough documentation throughout the development process.

## Overview

Proper documentation is crucial for project success, team collaboration, and knowledge transfer. This workflow ensures that all implementation work is properly documented and tracked.

## Mandatory Documentation Process

### Core Principle
**All implementation work must follow this documentation workflow without exception.**

### Three-Phase Documentation Workflow

#### Phase 1: Pre-Implementation Planning
**Before starting any implementation work:**

1. **Document Goals and Scope**
   - Add entry to `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md` in the daily log section
   - Clearly define what will be implemented
   - Set specific, measurable objectives

2. **Identify Blockers and Risks**
   - List potential technical challenges
   - Identify dependencies and prerequisites
   - Document known limitations or constraints

3. **Estimate Time and Effort**
   - Provide realistic time estimates
   - Break down complex tasks into smaller components
   - Set milestones for tracking progress

**Example:**
```markdown
### 2025-07-11 (Friday)

#### üìù Next Plan
- [ ] Implement logger.ts module with CustomLogExporter
- [ ] Expected completion: 2-3 hours
- [ ] Potential blockers: OpenTelemetry API complexity, OTLP format requirements
- [ ] Dependencies: @opentelemetry/sdk-logs, @opentelemetry/core
```

#### Phase 2: Learning During Implementation
**Whenever new technologies, APIs, or patterns are encountered:**

1. **Immediate Documentation**
   - Create learning notes immediately when learning occurs
   - Don't wait until the end of the implementation
   - Use the LEARNING_NOTES_TEMPLATE format

2. **Learning Notes Structure**
   - **File Location**: `documents/5-learning/LEARNING_NOTES_[YYYY-MM-DD].md`
   - **Format**: Use template structure with sections for concepts, examples, and key learnings
   - **Content**: Include code examples, API references, and implementation patterns

3. **Required Learning Note Triggers**
   - New library or framework usage
   - Complex algorithm or pattern implementation
   - Performance optimization techniques
   - Error handling strategies
   - Testing patterns and methodologies

**Example:**
```markdown
# OpenTelemetry Logs SDK Learning Notes

## Core Concepts Learned
- LoggerProvider singleton pattern
- BatchLogRecordProcessor configuration
- OTLP JSON format structure

## Code Examples
[Include actual code examples used]

## Key Insights
- Performance implications of batch processing
- Error handling patterns for network failures
```

#### Phase 3: Post-Implementation Documentation
**Immediately after completing implementation:**

1. **Update Development Log**
   - Mark tasks as completed in daily log
   - Document actual time spent vs. estimated
   - Record any discovered issues or changes

2. **Document Blocker Solutions**
   - How blockers were overcome
   - Alternative approaches considered
   - Lessons learned for future reference

3. **Performance Metrics**
   - Actual vs. target performance
   - Memory usage, bundle size, etc.
   - Test results and coverage

4. **Next Steps Planning**
   - Immediate next tasks
   - Dependencies for upcoming work
   - Potential improvements or refactoring needs

**Example:**
```markdown
#### ‚úÖ Completed Work
- [x] logger.ts implementation completed
  - Actual time: 3.5 hours (vs. estimated 2-3 hours)
  - Blocker resolved: OTLP format complexity solved using type mapping
  - Test coverage: 100% (17/17 tests passing)
  - Key learning: JavaScript number precision issues with large timestamps

#### üìù Next Plan
- [ ] Implement trace.ts module
- [ ] Expected completion: 1-2 hours
- [ ] Apply timestamp handling pattern learned from logger.ts
```

## Documentation Standards

### File Organization
```
documents/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 4-progress/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md           # Daily progress tracking
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ DEVELOPMENT_LOG_TEMPLATE.md  # Template for new projects
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 5-learning/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LEARNING_NOTES_[DATE].md     # Daily learning notes
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ LEARNING_NOTES_TEMPLATE.md   # Template for learning documentation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 6-templates/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [This guide and other templates]
```

### Writing Standards

#### Development Log Entries
- **Date Format**: YYYY-MM-DD (Day of week)
- **Time Tracking**: Actual vs. estimated time
- **Status Indicators**: ‚úÖ Completed, üîÑ In Progress, ‚è≥ Pending, üö´ Blocked
- **Measurable Outcomes**: Test counts, performance metrics, coverage percentages

#### Learning Notes
- **Concept Explanation**: Clear, concise explanations of new concepts
- **Code Examples**: Working code snippets with explanations
- **References**: Links to documentation, articles, or resources
- **Practical Applications**: How the learning applies to current project

### Quality Criteria

#### Completeness Checklist
- [ ] Goal clearly defined and measurable
- [ ] Implementation approach documented
- [ ] Blockers identified and solutions documented
- [ ] Learning notes created for new concepts
- [ ] Test results and metrics recorded
- [ ] Next steps clearly defined

#### Clarity Standards
- Use clear, concise language
- Include specific examples and code snippets
- Provide context for decisions and trade-offs
- Explain technical concepts for future reference

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Claude AI Development

#### Automatic Documentation Triggers
1. **Before Implementation**
   - Add planning entry to DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md
   - Set task status to "in_progress"

2. **During Implementation**
   - Create LEARNING_NOTES when encountering new concepts
   - Update progress if implementation takes longer than expected

3. **After Implementation**
   - Update DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md with completion status
   - Document actual time, test results, and metrics
   - Add lessons learned and next steps

#### Non-Compliance Consequences
- **Incomplete Work Status**: Implementation without proper documentation is considered incomplete
- **Quality Assurance**: Documentation serves as quality gate for implementation
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Proper documentation ensures knowledge is preserved and transferable

### For Human Developers

#### Daily Routine
1. **Morning**: Review previous day's documentation and plan current work
2. **During Work**: Document learning and blockers in real-time
3. **End of Day**: Update progress and plan next day's work

#### Weekly Review
- Review week's documentation for completeness
- Identify patterns in blockers or learning areas
- Update project templates with new insights

## Template Usage

### Starting New Projects
1. Copy `DEVELOPMENT_LOG_TEMPLATE.md` to `documents/4-progress/DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`
2. Copy `LEARNING_NOTES_TEMPLATE.md` to `documents/5-learning/`
3. Customize templates with project-specific information

### Maintaining Documentation
- Update templates based on project learnings
- Add new sections for project-specific needs
- Keep templates current with evolving best practices

## Benefits of This Workflow

### For Individual Developers
- **Improved Problem-Solving**: Documented solutions for future reference
- **Better Planning**: Historical data improves estimation accuracy
- **Knowledge Retention**: Written documentation reinforces learning

### For Teams
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Documented learning benefits entire team
- **Onboarding**: New team members can understand project history
- **Quality Assurance**: Consistent documentation standards ensure quality

### For Projects
- **Risk Mitigation**: Documented blockers and solutions prevent repeated issues
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regular documentation enables process refinement
- **Maintainability**: Well-documented code is easier to maintain and extend

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### Pitfall: Documentation Debt
**Problem**: Postponing documentation until later
**Solution**: Make documentation part of the implementation process, not an afterthought

### Pitfall: Superficial Documentation
**Problem**: Generic or vague documentation entries
**Solution**: Include specific examples, metrics, and actionable insights

### Pitfall: Inconsistent Format
**Problem**: Different documentation styles across team members
**Solution**: Use templates consistently and review documentation regularly

## Workflow Automation

### Automated Reminders
- Set up git hooks to remind about documentation
- Use IDE extensions to prompt for learning notes
- Create checklist templates for common tasks

### Integration with Development Tools
- Link documentation with code commits
- Include documentation status in pull request templates
- Automate documentation generation where possible
